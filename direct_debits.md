# Direct Debits
## How it works
With payments via Direct Debits, you clients can complete a payment or checkout transaction right on your web or mobile channel. They simply provide bank details and authorize a debit.
Direct Debits are particularly effective in setting up recurring payments. You have to worry about expired cards, issuers acquirers e.t.c as payments are made directly from bank accounts as long as they are authorized.
