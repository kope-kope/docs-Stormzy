# Accept Payments
## Overview
Accept mobile and web payments, by giving your clients seamless payment experiences, with options to “pay with transfer” or a “direct debit” from their bank accounts.
You can offer flexible payment options with a range or fixed amount, and set up recurring payment instructions, with little or no code.
By simplifying generating a multiple unique virtual account number to which your clients transfer to, or generate a payment schedule through our direct debits method.
Once payments are received, you get notified and settled in your preferred bank account
